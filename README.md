Eugene Geis, Greg Camilli, Stochastic Approximation Estimation Maximization algorithm as applied to an Multidimensional Item Response Theory model of dichotomous and polythomous response data, with a cumulative normal ogive response function.


Keywords: IRT, SAEM, MIRT, 2PNO, 3PNO

## Directions to get started

The best way to create an environment for this code is to create a new R-project, cloning this github repo.

1. In RStudio, choose: File > New Project > Version Control > Git 

2. The repository URL: https://github.com/genobobeno/SAEM_IRT
  i) Project directory will auto-fill.
  ii) Your choice of subdirectory is your prerogative.

3. Once your session is initiated, open the "START_HERE.Rmd" file to follow the tutorial. If you're most interested in the polytomous fits, open the "START_HERE_POLY_DEMO.Rmd" file.

Hope you enjoy!!
