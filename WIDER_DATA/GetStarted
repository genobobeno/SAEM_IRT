This is the help file to get you started running the code to analyze the RU Baseline data.
Do all steps in order if you do not have the software.
*********** FOR ALL THE STEPS 1-10, YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO DO THESE ONCE ************

1: Download and install R at http://www.r-project.org/

2: Download and install RStudio at http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/

3: Locate the folder "Eugenes_Work" that you copied from Dropbox, ya know, where you just opened this file? Take note of the location .../.../../Eugenes_Work/ 

4: Start RStudio and notice the console on the left column and the two windows in the second column on the right. 
    On top of the console is a small toolbar that includes little blue disks and a folder button. Click the folder button.
    
5: Find "Eugenes_Work," open it, and open the file Analyze.R

5a: The left column should now consist of two windows, the script window (with its own small toolbar on top) and the console below it. 
    Note: You can do simple math and simple commands in the console. Try typing > 4*223 [Enter] in the console. Anyway...
      
6: On the top Menu is the drop down menu "Session". Click on Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.
    Notice that it runs a command 'setwd(".../.../.../Eugenes_Work/")' in the console on the bottom left. 

6a: Replace the string named "WorkingDirectory" in the fourth line of the Analyze.R code with the string that was just 
    called in the setwd(WorkingDirectoryString) command in the console.

7: In the code Analyze.R, take note of the library("NameOfCodePackage") commands from lines 8-15. 
    On the top of the bottom right box, there is tab called "Packages." Click on it.
    
8: Now click on "Install Packages," which is directly below the Tabs. A new dialog should have just opened and there's a box awaiting your input.

9: You are going to install all of the packages that are being read into the window. It does not matter the order, so just start at the top
    and type in the name of the first package "maptools" -> Install (notice console window processing). "quantreg" -> Install... etc.
    Note: It should tell you that "MASS" and "parallel" are already installed. Not a big deal.

10: On the top of the script window (top left), there's a set of arrows, a shaded disk (save script), a box "Source on Save", etc. 
    Click on the box, enabling "Source on Save," then click on the disk to just that: "source" or RUN the script. 
    Note: You've just initiated all of the data and the functions. 
        It will load all the libraries you just installed, the data files in their directories, 
        and the functions whose descriptions just printed in the Console window. 
        
11: Read those directions and run the functions in the Console. Type ItemScript(24,yearcut=16) [Enter] and see what happens
    
    
12: Quit RStudio and Save the .RData (which means that you're saving the whole platform's layout right now)

13: Restart your RStudio and the script should be in the top left window. Source it again by clicking on the disk. You're all set to go again.
